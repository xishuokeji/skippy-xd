this repo forked from [https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd](https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd)
A few features have been added, which may not be suitable for everyone. The original version might be better.

1.Thumbnail display in single-line mode.

2. Minimized and iconized windows do not display.

3. A border is added to the selected window for easier identification.

4.Thumbnail background is the desktop, and transparency can be adjusted.

5.Low CPU usage, resolving long-term CPU usage issues when moving windows. No CPU bottleneck, and CPU usage is almost 0 most of the time.


Welcome to skippy-xd!

Skippy-xd is a lightweight, window-manager-agnostic window selector on the X server. With skippy-xd, you get live-preview on your alt-tab motions; you get the much coveted expose feature from Mac; you get a handy overview of all your virtual desktops in one glance with paging mode.

Switch is similar to Alt-Tab:

Expose is inspired from Mac:

Paging shows you your entire desktop:
