.TH SKIPPY-XD 1 "skippy-xd @VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
skippy-xd - lightweight X11 window selector with
switch/expose/paging.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B skippy-xd
.RI [ COMMAND  ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B skippy-xd
is a lightweight, window-manager-agnostic window
selector for the X server. It provides three window 
metaphors: switch (closest to Alt-Tab),
expose (inspired by macOS), paging
(overview of virtual desktops). These can be
activated via toggle or pivot activation modes.
.PP
The application works as a daemon that can be
controlled via command-line interface. When run without
arguments, it activates expose mode once without
connecting to the daemon.
.SS PARAMETERS

.TP
.B [NO PARAMETER]
Activate expose mode without connecting to any daemon processes.
.TP
.B Daemon Management
.TP
.SS
.B --start-daemon
Start skippy-xd as daemon. The daemon collects live preview
snapshots of windows in the background. These are used for
unmapped windows: usually windows that are
minimized or shaded windows, or windows on other virtual desktops.
.TP
.SS
.B --stop-daemon
Terminate the skippy-xd daemon.
.TP
.B Metaphors
.TP
.SS
.B --switch
Connect to the daemon and activate switch.
Switch is closest to Alt-Tab.
Combine with
.B --next
or
.B --prev
to focus the next/previous window.
.TP
.SS
.B --expose
Connect to the daemon and activate expose.
In expose, inspired by MacOS, windows fly out
and do not overlap, allowing selection by keyboard
and/or mouse.
.TP
.SS
.B --paging
Connect to the daemon and activate paging.
Paging displays overview of all virtual desktops.
.TP
.B Activation Modes
.TP
.SS
.B --toggle
Toggle skippy-xd on/off.
.TP
.SS
.B --pivot
.I KEY
Activate skippy-xd via pivot mode with the specified pivot key.
For example in Alt-Tab, Alt is the pivot key,
required to be held for activation. When the pivot
key is released, the currently highlighted window is
selected.

By default, expose and paging activates on toggle mode, while switch activates on pivot mode with Alt as pivot key.
.TP
.TP
.SS
.B --multi-select
Multi-select mode. Independent of toggle/pivot modes,
multi-select mode allows selecting multiple windows/desktops,
and returns all selected window/desktop IDs, enabling sophisticated scripting.
.TP
.B Window Filtering
.TP

.B --wm-class
.I CLASS

.TP
.SS
.B --wm-title

.B Return Value
Skippy-xd returns values based on whether it is the activating process:
.IP
If the skippy-xd command activated skippy-xd, it is guaranteed to return after the completion of skippy-xd selection, with the window ID (in case of switch and expose) or virtual desktop ID (in case of paging).
.IP
If the skippy-xd command did not activate skippy-xd, e.g. with toggling off of expose, or --next invocations of switch, then the command will return immediately with -1.
